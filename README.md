### How can I help?
I've solo-founded SDKs and apps with hundreds of thousands of users (over $4b in AUC), 
helped launch top-20 blockchains, led engineering teams, built developer relations programs and developed over a hundred production-quality applications for web, mobile and desktop.

Nothing makes me happier than empowering developers within my teams or the wider community to achieve the great things
that I know they are capable of, even if they don't yet see it in themselves.

**If you think I can help you or your team, you can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/nathan-s-james).**

I prefer to work within the **JavaScript** stack for web, but I am comfortable with many languages and frameworks

I am also very familiar with blockchain development at the core protocol level, smart contract level and application level,
primarily focused around EVM compatible chains such as Ethereum and Antelope chains such as Vaulta/EOS.
